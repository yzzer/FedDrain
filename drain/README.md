# Drain

Drain is an online log parser that can parse logs into structured events in a streaming and timely manner. It employs a parse tree with fixed depth to guide the log group search process, which effectively avoids constructing a very deep and unbalanced tree. 

### Running

The code has been tested in the following enviornment:
+ python 3.7.6
+ regex 2022.3.2
+ pandas 1.0.1
+ numpy 1.18.1
+ scipy 1.4.1

Run the following scripts to start the demo:

```
python demo.py
```

Run the following scripts to execute the benchmark:

```
python benchmark.py
```

### Benchmark

Running the benchmark script on Loghub_2k datasets, you could obtain the following results.
